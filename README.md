## 🏛️ Professional Overview
Strategic technology leader and trusted advisor with a track record of modernizing regulated, mission-critical platforms at scale. I specialize in aligning business strategy with technology execution through multi-year transformation roadmaps, governance frameworks, and scalable architecture patterns. 

My current focus is the **industrialization of AI**: moving LLM implementations from experimental "wrappers" to governed, deterministic, and cost-efficient enterprise ecosystems.

## 🤖 Featured AI Research & Implementation
### [Agentic RAG with Self-Correction Loop] 
A reference implementation for high-reliability RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using **LangGraph** and **Gemini 2.0 Flash**.

* **Design Pattern:** Implemented as a **State Machine** to ensure deterministic flow control solving the "black box" unpredictability of standard RAG.
* **Self-Correction Logic:** Employs an automated **Relevance Grader** to audit retrieval sets against user intent, triggering fallback loops when confidence thresholds are not met.
* **Infrastructure Resilience:** Architected to be LLM-agnostic; successfully implemented a seamless migration from OpenAI to Google Gemini to optimize for **FinOps** and API availability.

## 🛠️ Expertise & Strategic Focus
* **Cloud Architecture:** AWS Professional certification, EKS, Serverless, and Cloud-Native refactoring.
* **Distributed Systems:** High-throughput event-driven design using Apache Kafka and Java/Spring Boot.
* **Enterprise Governance:** Tech roadmapping for ROI, FinOps-led cost management, and DevSecOps.
* **AI Orchestration:** LangChain/LangGraph, Vector Database optimization (ChromaDB), and Prompt Engineering.

## 💼 Strategic Philosophy
> "I bridge the gap between C-suite vision and engineering execution, ensuring that emerging technologies like AI/LLMs serve as drivers of measurable business value rather than sources of technical debt."
